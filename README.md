# Prediction-of-football-player-s-value
Football, or soccer, is one of the most well-known sports in the world. There is no doubt that football
is regarded as the “king of sports”. According to The Irish Times, English Premier League
broadcasting is valued at £1.6 billion per season, and many more football leagues are making billions
of dollars of money annually. The high numbers were also reported by other leagues. However, for
clubs, the game isn’t completely fair: large clubs always get the larger piece of cake, thus, being able
to reinvest and remain their throne, while small clubs often struggle to do so, and in the worst case, get
relegated and get into deeper debt. Therefore, instead of waiting for miracles to happen, like the story
of Leicester City in 2016, many small to average clubs have been trying to make use of the transfer
market. One of the most popular stories is EPL club Brentford’s Moneyball strategy, where they try to
buy undervalued talents from a market that is less inflated than England.
So how did Brentford find out those players? Having the same owner as a betting company, they were
provided statistical research that helps them analyze players that fit the club’s philosophy. Moreover,
the transfer market in Europe takes place every year, and while there are successful cases such as
Brentford, many transfers also can be considered failures. Harry Maguire, Eden Hazard, Jack Grealish,
and many other players contribute to their clubs fewer than what they have spent to sign them.
Therefore, evaluation of player values is very important for team managers, especially for target
players that they want to sign. This project aims to help managers estimate player prices based on
player statistics and their performance in the past, and particularly the 2021-2022 season. Our project
is applying Machine Learning methods to predict the price of football players who are playing in the
top 5 leagues in Europe: Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1.
